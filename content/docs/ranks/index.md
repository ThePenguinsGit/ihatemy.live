We have a **custom**, **network wide**, **time based level up system**! The second you join any of our servers for the first time it starts counting. Watching. Motionless. Soullless. The gears in this machine were only made for tracking **you**, yes specifically **you**. **Don't stare back**.

If you wanna know more about your own stats, check the [Leaderboard](/docs/ranks/leaderboard), or our [Commands](/docs/getting-started/useful-commands) page!
