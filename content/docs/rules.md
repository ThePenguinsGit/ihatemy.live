::card

- Obviously follow Discord's global rules! They can be found here https://discordapp.com/terms
- No NSFW Content!
- Streaming to Twitch and other streaming websites is allowed on this server!
- No racism or any of those other -isms allowed here!
- If you have drama with someone, solve it in private.
- No griefing permitted at all!
- No self promotion or promotions of other servers
- Just don't @ the admins too much - and admins: don't overuse @ everyone 
- No bypassing AFK-Kick (FTB Chunkloading works if any teammate is online)
- Try to work with ender chests a lot instead of item pipes -> they are a lot faster than any pipes anyways so..
- Excessive factories breed bad habits and lower the TPS!
(5 quarries -> need more ore processing -> need more ME system space)
- Oh and most importantly, accept everyone, as long as no one gets hurt!
-  Don't go claiming a huge area of the map without using it!
- Don't actively _try_ to make the map ugly (No empty, quarried out areas for example)
## In general these rules can be simplified to:
- **Just don't be an asshole to people!**
- **And don't be an asshole to the tps!**
- **Dont try to "outsmart" the rules, you're not that guy.**
### If anyone breaks a rule. Even in your DM's. Don't be afraid to DM/Mention mods or admins. it'll only help us!
