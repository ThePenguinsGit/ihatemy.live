## Which hosting service do you use?
We host some modpacks of our on Hetzner, others we host our selves.
## Can you add mod X to the server?
Unfortunately, if the mod isn't server-side only, **all players** will have to manually download that single mod too! So the answer is no, unfortunately.
## Can I join the staff team?
We're currently not looking for new staff members, but we might be in the future!
## Can you host modpack Y?
Maybe? Go and post a modpack request on our discord in the [#suggestions](https://discord.com/channels/637719625274228743/1151595305872146652) channel!
## Can I host a network by myself?
I don't know, can you?!?!?!
## Do penguins have feathers or fur?
👁️👄👁️ (???)
## I am having issue X, please help!!
Take a look at [#tech-support](https://discord.com/channels/637719625274228743/677466545135550475), maybe someone had the same problem recently aswell.  
If not, feel free to ask, and you'll get the help you need!
## Are there any plans to wipe the overworld?
Probably not. We only wipe maps if they are beyond repair (check [Performance](/docs/getting-started/performance) (yes this is a threat)), but we do post downloads to all of our maps (check [ihatemy.live](/))
