## Dimension Resets
As opposed to our other servers, we only reset Dimensions on request.

## GTNH Special Notes
- Pollution is turned off entirely, so no stinky machines! :)
- Machine chain explosions are disabled (You do still lose the machine, it doesn't trigger a chain explosion though)
- For some documentation take a look at the [Wiki](https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Main_Page){:target="_blank"}
- Currently everyone has five home slots, flat
- We adhere to the requirements of the [Stargate Discord Role](https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Stargate){:target="_blank"} on the official [GTNH Discord](https://discord.gg/gtnh){:target="_blank"}
- Most Level Up Bonuses don't apply to GTNH _yet_ (like `/jump`, `/feed`, `/heal`, etc.)

## The Farmworld
Since we don't reset the Overworld we have a Farmworld which gets reset (and regenerated when the worldgen of the pack changes)  
You can access it by running `/warp farmworld`

## Worldborders
Most(!) dimensions have a world border of 20k! (-10000, -10000 to 10000,10000)  
There are exceptions:
### 25k:
- The End

## Chunkloaders
To force-load chunks in your base (while any party member is online), go to the chunk claim menu and shift-left-click (right-click to delete)  
Offline chunkloading exists 4 hours after the last player of your team has left the server.
Also notice the chunk amounts aren't tied to your rank as opposed to our other servers.  
Every player has 100 loaded chunks and 300 claim chunks.  
__Note that this is subject to change!__
