## The Farmworld
Since we don't reset the Overworld we have a Farmworld which gets reset (and regenerated when the worldgen of the pack changes)  
You can access it by running `/warp farmworld`

## Notes
Please do keep in mind that loot chests in the world are per-player, per-chest so everyone has their own unique loot!  
Also do keep in mind, that these world borders can always be expanded if we need more space!
