If you want to help us fund our current and future Minecraft hosting endeavors, you can support us via <a href='https://ko-fi.com/penguinnetwork'  target="_blank">Ko-fi</a>.
<img style="float: right;" src="/img/docs/prefixes.png">  
It helps us to keep the servers running and to expand our network.  
As a reward you will receive
- Early access to new modpack servers
- Exclusive prefixes in chat depending on your tier!  
One-time donations are also always welcome!  
You can even join the **current** pre-release server with donations of 5€ or above! (Check out [Pre-Releases](/docs/donations/pre-release) for more details)  
Anyone who donates any amount gets the "Contributor" role forever!

## Boosting
While Ko-Fi is still the preferred way for supporting us, you can also get some great benefits by Boosting our Discord Server!  
This also includes the free Boosts that come with any Discord Nitro subscription.  
You'll be receiving all benefits from `Stellar Sponsor` and a special `Booster` Prefix.   
This also includes access to all pre-release servers while you're an active booster!  
As with all other donation tiers, you will also keep the `Contributer` role forever afterward.
