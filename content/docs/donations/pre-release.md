## What is a "Pre-Release"?
When we're close to publicly releasing a new modpack server we generally put it into a "Pre-Release" first  
You can also consider it a beta, we might've not fully figured out everything we need to make it publicly available

## How can I join?
To be eligible to get whitelisted you'll need to either
- be a Ko-Fi member (Stellar Sponsor and up) or Founder
- donate 5 bucks or more per Pre-Release
Afterward you can DM/Ping/message/threaten the Owners to whitelist you

## Why do we do this?
- To provide earlier access to our new servers for our most devoted players while we still figure things out for the general public  
- You can give us quicker feedback if you think we can improve certain aspects  
- To make sure the server is up to our """**_quality_**™""" and """"""**_standards_**™""""""
- [special reason no. 12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ0McZsUPh0){:target="_blank"} ;)
- Servers do actually cost a lot :(
