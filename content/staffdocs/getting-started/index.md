## Foreword 
Our community is a great one, tons of very nice & helpful people, but sometimes there's people that need to be "reeled in". Even when following the rules, sometimes players just need to be told that they are overdoing it.  
We try to foster a safe space where everyone can be themselves and have fun! A place that'll always be there if you need a distraction from life. No matter who you are.

## Pelican Panel
We use Pelican as a server management tool. You can do all sorts of things on it like starting/stopping/killing servers, changing files, changing startup arguments and many more!
## How do I access our servers?
After being invited to a server, you can head to [this page](https://panel.ihatemy.live).
After logging in, you'll be able to see it in your list.  
Everything you do will be visible to the owners, tread lightly!

## What is staff working on?
We use Trello to keep track of current tasks/ideas
Trello is a cool little websites where we write down and plan upcoming features, current issues and a lot of other things!

## Retiring
Sometimes life gets in the way and you don't have time to play or be active in the Discord. Sometimes you're just not up for playing Minecraft! These things happen.   
Be sure to let us know when you're done playing for the time being. We'll give you the "Inactive" roles(corresponding to your rank), which you'll lose once you're active again.

If you dont give us a heads up about leaving yu'll be marked as inactive after _some time_.  
You'll still be a staff member and you'll be able to see all Discord channels, but you won't be pinged anymore from people looking for help.
You'll also recieve the ❰Inactive❱ prefix on Discord.  
If you want to, we can also just remove/demote your staff rank if you dont feel up for the task for the time being.
