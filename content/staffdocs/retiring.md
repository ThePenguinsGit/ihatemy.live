Sometimes life gets in the way and you don't have time to play or be active in the Discord. Sometimes you're just not up for playing Minecraft! These things happen. Be sure to let us know when you're done playing for the time being. We'll give you the "retired" status, which you'll lose once you're active again.

If you dont give us a heads up we'll give you the retired role after INSERT X TIME OF BEING INACTIVE. You'll still be a staff member and you'll be able to see all discord channels still, but you won't be pinged anymore from people looking for help.
