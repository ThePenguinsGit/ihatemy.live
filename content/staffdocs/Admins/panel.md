We use Pelican as a server management tool. You can do all sorts of things on it like starting/stopping/killing servers, changing files, changing startup arguments and many more!
## How do I access our servers?
After being invited to a server, you can head to [this page](https://panel.ihatemy.live).
After logging in, you'll be able to see it in your list.  
Everything you do will be visible to the owners, tread lightly!
