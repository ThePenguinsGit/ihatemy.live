## Where, when and why we advertise
We generally advertise in 2 places, Reddit and different Discord servers. Generally all of these places have different rules about time that needs to pass in between posts. Without advertising, we do not see any growth other than the random "word of mouth" players.

## Why does staff need to know?
In general, only the server owners are allowed to advertise their servers, but staff can help! By helping spread info about the servers and interacting with them.

## Reddit
There's tons of subreddits we can post on! They all have different rules! Yikes!

Theres a channel on discord called #server-ad-drafts where we posted drafts for each and every one of these subreddits.

## Discord
This one depends on a lot of factors, but most modpack servers have a channel for network owners to advertise in. Every single server has different rules for formatting and word count.
