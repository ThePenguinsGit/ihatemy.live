## Dealing with Players
So, generally everyone in our community is calm, but there are exceptions. Often the exceptions are immediately obvious, they just have a different _vibe_.  
When dealing with people who just kinda don't _get it_, a playful threat (I'm not joking) will make them rethink for a second and change their attitude. If it happens again, try a more firm approach. If that doesnt work.. we generally believe in second chances here, but sometimes people just overstay their welcome and need to be "brought out back" and "banned" in the head.
