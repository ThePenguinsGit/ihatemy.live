## Updating Modpack versions
To update the modpack version for a specific server you need to first delete these folders:
- /mods
- /config
- /defaultconfigs
- /packmenu
- /kubeJS  
Then you can update servers(if they are using the curseforge generic egg) by clicking the "reinstall server" button in the admin area in our panel!  
The last step is uploading the current "Server Update" folder as a zip from our shared nextcloud and unzipping it.  
**if the modpack has FTB-ranks, delete it**  
This shouldn't be done without notifying an owner/dev, so they can help oversee/fix possible issues and change the modpack versions on our website/discord/advertisements.
