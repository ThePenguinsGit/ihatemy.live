## 
Our community is a great one, tons of very nice & helpful people, but sometimes there's people that need to be "reeled in". Even when following the rules, sometimes players just need to be told that they are overdoing it.  

We try to foster a safe space where everyone can be themselves and have fun! A place that'll always be there if you need a distraction from life.
