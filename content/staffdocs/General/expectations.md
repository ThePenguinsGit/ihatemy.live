# Mod
Mods are expected to watch and moderate chat/players. They do not get /op or any related permissions, but they do get extra commands centered around moderating chat and banning/kicking people. They also handle smaller tasks and might be asked to help build structures for new servers.

# Admin
Admins are expected to deal with problems, player problems, server problems(like server config changes/helping with crashes) and in-game problems(like resetting quests/restoring lost items).
They aren't expected to add features like quests, but if they want, they can! They get /op, related permissions and panel access to do some (light) server management.
Admins can also update modpack servers and switch around mods if they are causing problems.

# Dev
All of the above, they are also expected to add features, fix big boi problems and do all sorts of backend/frontend engineering stuff like server deployment/updating.
