Sometimes life gets in the way and you don't have time to play or be active in the Discord. Sometimes you're just not up for playing Minecraft! These things happen.   
Be sure to let us know when you're done playing for the time being. We'll give you the "Inactive" roles(corresponding to your rank), which you'll lose once you're active again.

If you dont give us a heads up about leaving yu'll be marked as inactive after _some time_.  
You'll still be a staff member and you'll be able to see all Discord channels, but you won't be pinged anymore from people looking for help.
You'll also recieve the ❰Inactive❱ prefix on Discord.  
If you want to, we can also just remove/demote your staff rank if you dont feel up for the task for the time being.
