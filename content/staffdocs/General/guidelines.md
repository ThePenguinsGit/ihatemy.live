## Foreword 
Our community is a great one, tons of very nice & helpful people, but sometimes there's people that need to be "reeled in". Even when following the rules, sometimes players just need to be told that they are overdoing it.  
We try to foster a safe space where everyone can be themselves and have fun! A place that'll always be there if you need a distraction from life. No matter who you are.
## Dealing with Players
So, generally everyone in our community is calm, but there are exceptions. Often the exceptions are immediately obvious, they just have a different _vibe_.  
When dealing with people who just kinda don't _get it_, a playful threat (I'm not joking) will make them rethink for a second and change their attitude. If it happens again, try a more firm approach. If that doesnt work.. we generally believe in second chances here, but sometimes people just overstay their welcome and need to be "brought out back" and "banned" in the head.
