## Our servers sit behind a proxy. This is important for a bunch of reasons!
Our proxy handles:
 - In game Minecraft chat
 - Discord <-> Minecraft chat
 - Player management
 - Permission management
 - Authentication
 - Our fancy tablist
 - Our fancy message of the day
 - Maintenance mode
 - Incoming player connections

 All these fancy features come from plugins installed on the proxy.   
 This means if you wanna run any proxy specific commands, you need to run them from ingame chat (which is handled by the proxy) or the actual proxy console.
